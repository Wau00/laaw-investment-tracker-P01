THE PURPOSE OF THIS PLATFORM

This platform was created with the intention of making it easy for any user curious about the current stock market. 
The search bar function allows the user to add a stock they would like to track. The watchlist then generates correlating
news articles updating the user of current prices,data and other important details. 

The easy navigation in this application allows the user to focus solely on the stock(s) they are trying to follow. This allows for easy grasping of the stock market.
